    <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span><br>

      <span style="font-size:17px ;">Good nutrition, daily exercise and adequate sleep are the foundations of healthy
        living. A healthy lifestyle keeps
        you fit, energetic and at reduced risk for disease. According to WHO, Healthy living is a way of living that
        helps
        you enjoy more aspects of your life. It is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying
        early. Health is not just about avoiding a disease or illness. It is about physical, mental and social
        well-being
        too.<br>

        When you adopt a healthy lifestyle, you provide a more positive role model for other people in your family,
        particularly children. You will also create a better environment for them to grow up in. By helping them to
        follow a
        healthier lifestyle, you will be contributing to their wellbeing and enjoyment of life now and in the future.
        <br>
        Managing stress in positive ways, instead of through smoking or drinking alcohol, reduces wear and tear on your
        body
        at the molecular level. For a longer and more comfortable life, you should adopt a healthy life style. Following
        factors may affect your lifestyle on regular basis.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> Eating</strong></span><br>

      <span style="font-size:17px ;"> Your heart, muscles, bones, immune system and other body systems depend on a
        continual supply of nutrients for cell
        growth and metabolism. You need to eat varied diet to get essential nutrients in the form of protein, vitamins,
        carbohydrates, minerals and fats. Consume lean meat such as chicken along with legumes, eggs and nuts for
        healthy
        living. Limit your portion size at meals to control your weight and your risk for cardiovascular and other
        diseases
        through your lifestyle. If you want to control your weight and reduce the risk of various diseases, you make
        sure
        that the diet is nutritious, in addition to limiting portion size.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Exercising</strong></span>
      <br>
      <span style="font-size:17px ;">Calories accompany the nutrition in food and if you don’t exercise, you’ll gain
        weight. Carrying extra weight
        increases your risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Your lifestyle should support a
        constant
        healthy weight for normal daily activity. You should always do muscle strengthening exercises, such as weight
        lifting, along with aerobic exercises, such as walking or running. You should also include exercise, such as
        yoga to
        improve body flexibility.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> Sleeping</strong></span> <br>
      <span style="font-size:17px ;">Daily metabolism perpetuates the decline and rejuvenation of cellular tissue and
        the body’s self-repair takes place
        when you are asleep. Memory consolidation and appetite regulation also occur during this time of reduced
        physical
        activity. Seven to nine hours of night sleep daily is considered an optimum for most individuals for a healthy
        lifestyle.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> Reducing Stress</strong></span><br>
      <span style="font-size:17px ;">Your body responds to everyday stress with a release of hormones that prepares you
        to react.Although some stress is
        inevitable and necessary, excess can lead to various health problems.If you don’t relieve this excessively
        stressful
        state through relaxation, the effects build and can create muscular pain, headaches, sleep disturbances and
        other
        symptoms. A lifestyle that includes regular stress management, breaks this cycle before it can progress to
        unhealthy
        levels. You can achieve physical relaxation through stretching, body massage, yoga or enjoyable exercise.
        Connect
        with friends and family to relieve mental pressures and take time out to read, pursue a hobby or experience
        another
        activity that makes you feel good.</span>

  <!-- BENFITS OF HELATHY LIFESTYLE -->
  <div>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 30px; "><strong>What are the benefits of a healthy
          lifestyle?</strong></span></p>

    <p style="padding: 5%; margin-top: -1%;">Do you need some extra motivation to follow a more healthy lifestyle? These
      benefits of a
      healthy lifestyle may be just what you need to commit to changing your daily habits into healthier ones. And trust
      me, once you make those changes and experience their positive effects you won’t want to go back! <br><br>

      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> 1. You’ll improve your physical health</strong></span><br>
      Eating the right foods in combination with physical activity and adequate rest is a recipe for a healthy body.
      Find
      any form of movement that gives you joy. Perhaps this is hiking a fourteener, taking a yoga class online, lifting
      weights at the gym, or simply walking your kids home from school. All forms of movement count towards improving
      your
      health.<br><br>

      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> 2. You’ll improve your mental health</strong></span><br>
      It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle of work, kids, and other responsibilities, but part of maintaining a
      healthy
      mind involves taking time to step back and relax. This includes getting adequate sleep, but also taking time for
      yourself to do something you love. This might involve taking a walk away from your desk, reading a good book,
      taking a
      5-minute guided meditation, or playing with your pet. Engaging in these types of activities can decrease your
      stress
      and improve your overall mental health.<br><br>

      <br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> 3. You’ll get more energy naturally</strong></span><br>
      Don’t underestimate the power of sleep. Experts suggest that adults need anywhere from 7 to 9 hours of sleep each
      night in order to function at their best. Prioritizing sleep while also fueling your body with the right foods can
      help you have more energy naturally. This means you won’t have to drink five cups of coffee to feel like a
      functioning
      human being.<br><br>
      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>4. You’ll boost your mood</strong></span><br>
      Most people know that eating better is good for your body, but it can be just as helpful for your mind. A healthy
      diet including plenty of healthy fats like omega-3s which can reduce depression and decrease mood disorders. Foods
      high in omega-3s include fish, especially fatty fish such as salmon, flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.
      <br>
      Physical exercise has also been found to improve your mood by increasing the production of the “feel-good
      hormone”, serotonin. Serotonin can keep you emotionally stable and reduce feelings of depression, making physical
      activity a great way to boost your mood and live a happier life!<br><br>

      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> 5. You’ll prevent diseases and health issues</strong></span> <br>
      Many aspects of a healthy lifestyle can aid in preventing certain diseases and health issues such as obesity,
      diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In fact, multiple studies show that engaging in healthy lifestyle
      activities can give people a longer life free of chronic diseases. So although many diseases and health issues are
      out of our control, we still have the ability to empower ourselves and live a longer, healthier life through the
      choices we make.<br><br>

      <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>6. You’ll save money</strong></span><br>
      A healthy lifestyle involves eating nutrient-dense foods that make you feel nourished and satisfied. This is often
      accomplished by cooking your meals at home with ingredients on hand. Cooking for yourself can help you save money
      by eating out less. Also, as mentioned in benefit #5, a healthy diet may prevent diseases and health issues which
      means less trips to the doctor and more money in your pocket!

    <br><br>
    <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> 7. You’ll always have goals to work towards</strong></span><br>
    Achieving a healthy lifestyle involves many aspects of your life–how you eat,how you move your body, and how you
    engage in self care activities. Try to improve one area at a time by setting goals. Reaching your goals can help you
    feel accomplished and boost your overall self confidence. Be sure to make your goals SMART.

    performance.<br>
