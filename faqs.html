        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> What is a healthy diet?</strong></span><br>


        The fundamental principle to a healthy diet comes down to one word; balance. Many other factors are included to
        ensure a balanced diet, but essentially eating enough food that provides the range of nutrients your body
        requires
        encourages the promotion of good health. It is important to ensure this variety of foods, guaranteeing a broad
        range
        of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals that your body needs. When you are receiving too little or too much of
        certain elements, this can result in health problems. That is why moderation and control of your diet is
        important.
        For example, fats are a necessary part of your diet, but when they exceed the body’s required amount, it can be
        stored in the body, potentially causing problems, most importantly cardiovascular issues.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>   How can you benefit from a healthy diet?</strong></span><br>
        Eating a healthy diet most obviously will assist you in losing weight, but healthy eating has many other
        benefits.
        Changing your diet can significantly improve your general health, tackling diseases associated with heart
        conditions
        and cholesterol, as well as aiding diabetes, types of cancers, and even depression. Those who eat a balanced and
        healthy diet are generally considered to live longer lives because of these health benefits. Diet changes can
        also
        boost energy levels as high sugar and fat based foods are generated into energy quickly and so run out quickly,
        leaving us fatigued. Healthier foods release energy at a slower rate, producing a slower and more sustainable
        release of energy over a longer period of time. Healthy eating can not only improve your body but can change
        your
        mood; making you feel more positive and more relaxed, particularly when combined with exercise.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> How can you achieve a healthy diet?</strong></span> <br>
        The general rules for healthy eating is that natural foods are generally healthy, and if a product has been
        overly
        processed it may contain unhealthy ingredient such as added sugars or ‘bad’ fats. Cutting down on sugars, fats
        and
        salts is usually a good place to start when changing a diet as these elements are usually the problem, and
        instead,
        replace them with natural products such as fruits, veg, nuts, seeds grains and so on. The key to a healthy diet
        is
        balance and ensuring the correct amounts of each dietary element. Your diet should include a range of carbs,
        proteins, vitamins and mineral, fats and dairy, which in appropriate amounts can help you feel the health
        benefits
        that follow with a healthy diet.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> What is the relationship between eating healthily and calories?</strong></span> <br>
        Calories are your body’s source of fuel. We need to refuel our energy supply by eating food, yet many diets have
        branded calories as our enemy for weight, yet calories are a necessary part of our lives. A regular man should
        aim
        for around 2500 calories, and a woman around 2,000 calories per day for a healthy diet, unless trying to lose
        weight. Generally high calorie foods indicate a higher amount of salt, sugars or fat, yet some foods that are
        naturally high in calories are a useful, nutritious inclusion to a healthy diet. Corn, nuts, avocados, olive
        oil,
        and whole grain breads are all calorie-rich but beneficial foods, providing a variety of nutrients needed in
        your
        diet and also provide long lasting satisfaction to other healthy foods that fail to fill you up.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> Are carbs unhealthy?</strong></span><br>
        Many popular diets brand carbs as bad for your waistline and therefore your health, which when consumed
        excessively
        with other nutrients can have a negative effect, but carbs are an essential element to your diet. Many different
        foods contain carbs, including the typical foods such as pastas and breads, yet fruits and vegetables also
        contain
        carbohydrates, which are a healthy source of not only energy but also vitamins and nutrients. Processed
        carbohydrates can impact your health, and when trying to lose weight restricting carbs may be helpful, but carbs
        are
        a significant element to a balanced diet and when consumed sensibly contribute greatly to your healthy eating.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>  Are foods that contain sugar unhealthy?</strong></span><br>
        Sugar can be an enemy to a healthy diet, tasting so delicious in a variety of food and even hidden in foods that
        you
        wouldn’t suspect. Yet it is important to address the difference between natural and added sugars for a healthy
        diet.
        Sugars are carbs which provide a vital source of energy and nutrition, yet many popular foods have sugar added
        to
        them, this is when sugars become unhealthy. Fruits and some vegetables contain naturally occurring sugars which
        are
        considered healthy when not consumed in overly excessive amounts, but added sugars provide nearly no nutritional
        value and contribute significantly to weight gain, damaging your health diet. It is therefore important to check
        the
        labels to ensure no products contain hidden added sugars.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> How can a healthy diet affect cholesterol?</strong></span><br>
        Cholesterol is a fat based substance that is needed within the body, but when present in excessive amounts can
        cause
        serious health problems. Low density cholesterol will cause blocks in the arteries, significantly increasing the
        risk of heart disease, all is not lost however as the levels of bad cholesterol can be reduced by what you eat.
        Not
        eating enough protective fats such as nuts and seeds, along with eating high saturated fat foods increases the
        cholesterol found in the blood. Basic changes such as consuming more fruits, vegetables, lean or fat-free animal
        products and high fibre foods will reduce your cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular
        diseases.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> What is omega-3 and why should you eat it?</strong></span><br>
        As healthy eating and fitness become more present in the consciousness of society, much debate has surrounded
        whether fats should be included into a healthy diet and if so which fats. As the tag word ‘superfood’ has
        emerged,
        omega-3 has been branded as the superfood of the fat group, proving to be particularly beneficial for many
        issues.
        These include depression, memory loss, heart issues, joint and skin problems, and the general promotion of
        health
        and wellbeing, both physically and mentally. Found most richly in fish based foods, omega-3 is considered as an
        essential fatty acid for a healthy diet.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> How important are fruit and veg?</strong></span> <br>
        To achieve a healthy diet, vegetables and fruit must be a vital feature to ensure the access to a mixture of
        vitamins and minerals that are abundant within them. Not only do fruit and veg provide a rich source of
        vitamins,
        minerals and antioxidants, they also serve as a source of energy, aid weight loss and can be an influential tool
        in
        the prevention of disease. Vegetables and fruit can improve the functions of the heart, kidneys, bones and
        prevent
        the onset of cancers, diabetes and other diseases. Without the inclusion of fruits and veg, your body will be
        considerably deficient in vital nutrients needed for all bodily functions from the working of the brain to
        growing
        hair and nails.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong> In what way is fibre healthy?</strong></span><br>
        Fibre is an essential element for any balanced diet, its main purpose is the promotion of digestive health and
        the
        movement of the digestive system, but fibre also has many other health benefits. Prevention of heart disease,
        diabetes, weight gain, cancers and so on are all influenced by fibre, making it a necessary part of a healthy
        lifestyle. Both soluble, being ingested into the body to assist with the reduction of cholesterol and
        nutritional
        value, and insoluble, assisting the movement of food through the digestive system, are very important for the
        smooth
        functioning of the body and when deficient can result in serious health problem. Fibre can be found in a variety
        of
        foods such as oats, cereals, breads, rice, vegetable and fruits and so are easily implemented into any type of
        diet
        and lifestyle.<br>
